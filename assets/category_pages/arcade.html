                                    <strong>Grand Theft Auto V (GTA 5)</strong> is one of the most
                                    influential open-world action-adventure
                                    games ever created, developed by Rockstar North and published by
                                    Rockstar Games. Since its release, it
                                    has completely redefined the sandbox genre with its sprawling world,
                                    cinematic missions, and seamless
                                    transition between three unique protagonists: Michael, Franklin, and
                                    Trevor. <br>
                                    Set in the fictional state of San Andreas, GTA 5 invites players to
                                    explore the vibrant city of Los
                                    Santos and its diverse surroundings — from bustling streets and high-end
                                    neighborhoods to rugged hills
                                    and military bases. Each character has their own backstory, missions,
                                    and special abilities, offering
                                    varied gameplay experiences within the same narrative. <br>
                                    The game features an unprecedented level of freedom and interactivity,
                                    allowing you to drive dozens of
                                    vehicles, complete chaotic heists, engage in side activities like tennis
                                    or yoga, or simply explore the
                                    richly detailed environment. The in-game radio stations, humorous
                                    satire, dynamic weather, and AI
                                    interactions make the world feel alive and ever-changing. <br>
                                    GTA 5 also includes access to <strong>GTA Online</strong>, a multiplayer
                                    mode where players can complete
                                    jobs, race vehicles, start businesses, or create chaos with friends in a
                                    shared world. With constant
                                    updates and community content, the online experience is practically
                                    limitless.

                                                Activision announced the title during pre-production on April 9, 2010,
                                                with a release date set for November 8, 2011. Initially, Sledgehammer
                                                Games was slated to collaborate with Infinity Ward on all aspects of the
                                                game’s development, replacing the canceled action-adventure project.
                                                Raven Software assisted with the user interface and downloadable content
                                                (DLC), as they had done with previous Call of Duty titles. DLC was
                                                released monthly for nine months and was provided free of charge to
                                                users of the Call of Duty ELITE Premium service. Sledgehammer Games
                                                assumed responsibility for the service without any issues, with over 95%
                                                of the objectives achieved. <br><br>
